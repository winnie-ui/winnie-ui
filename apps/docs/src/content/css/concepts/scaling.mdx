Often times users have a preference for the percieved size of elements in their application. Winnie supports this concept via the `data-scale` attribute. The scaling attribute modifies css values which affect the overall density of the layout in the application.

```tsx title="root.tsx" ins="class="winnie-ui"" ins="data-scale="100%""
export default function Root() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head></head>
      <body class="winnie-ui" data-scale="100%">
        <App />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Scaling Factor

Winnie provides a scaling factor token that you can use to create custom components that adhere to the overall density of your application.

| Scaling | Factor |
| ------- | ------ |
| 90%     | 0.90   |
| 95%     | 0.95   |
| 100%    | 1.00   |
| 105%    | 1.05   |
| 110%    | 1.10   |

Scaling factors can be used with the `calc` function in css. By default all `space`, `font-size`, `line-height`, `border-width`, and `border-radius` have scale calculated for them.

```css title="movie-card.css" ins="var(--wui-scale)"
.movie-card {
  height: calc(48px * var(--wui-scale));
}
```

## Example

Putting this all together, we can create a component that scales across the different factors seamlessly.

<Demo>
  <ScalingExample client:load />
</Demo>
