Winnie CSS is a collection of CSS primitives designed to help style applications in any framework. Whether you use plain old CSS, Tailwind, or any variety of CSS-in-JS, Winnie CSS provides the primitive styles you need to build the best experience for your users.

## Installation

### Install Winnie CSS

The simplest way to get up and running with Winnie CSS in any app is to start by installing Winnie CSS with the package manager of your choice. We will use `npm`, but `yarn` and `pnpm` also work as well.

```bash
npm install @winnie-ui/css
```

### Import the Style Sheet

Once you have Winnie CSS installed, you can then import the stylesheet in the root of your application.

```css title="global.css"
@import "@winnie-ui/css";
```

### Configure your Theme

Now, with Winnie CSS installed and imported, it's time to configure your theme. Winnie CSS allows you to choose the accent color, scale and border radius of your app. If you are looking to be more adventurous, see [Customize Theme](/css/docs/asdasd) for more information about how to customize your theme.

```tsx title="root.tsx" {6-10}
export default function Root() {
  return (
    <html>
      <head>...</head>
      <body
        class="winnie-ui"
        data-accent-color="purple"
        data-scale="100%"
        data-radius="md"
        data-theme="light"
      >
        <App />
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

To see how these different attributes affect the look and feel of an application, play around with the theme selector located in the top left. Everything in this documentation is built 100% with Winnie CSS.
